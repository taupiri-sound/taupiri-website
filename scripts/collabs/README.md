# Collaborations Population Script

This directory contains scripts and data for populating Sanity CMS with collaboration data.

## Files

- `collabs.json` - Sample collaboration data for C.R. Avery and Star Control
- `populate-collabs.js` - Script to import collaboration data into Sanity CMS
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Running the Population Script

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have the required environment variables set in your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=your-dataset
   SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN=your-write-token
   ```

2. Ensure you have write permissions to your Sanity dataset (the API token needs write access)

### Running the Script

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
node scripts/collabs/populate-collabs.js
```

### What the Script Does

The script will:

1. ‚úÖ Read collaboration data from `collabs.json`
2. ‚úÖ Transform the data to match Sanity's document structure
3. ‚úÖ Create collaboration documents in your Sanity CMS
4. ‚úÖ Preserve basic content like text, social links, and simple CTAs
5. ‚úÖ Handle rich text content and quotes

### What the Script Excludes

For simplicity and to avoid asset management issues, the script **does not** create:

- ‚ùå Image assets (hero images, preview images, gallery images)
- ‚ùå Image galleries
- ‚ùå Spotify/Bandcamp widgets
- ‚ùå Complex media blocks

### Post-Script Manual Steps

After running the script, you'll need to manually add in Sanity Studio:

1. **Upload Images**: Add hero images, preview images, and any content images
2. **Image Galleries**: Add gallery blocks with uploaded images
3. **Media Widgets**: Add Spotify and Bandcamp embed blocks
4. **Internal Links**: Fix any internal page references in CTAs
5. **Review Content**: Check all content renders correctly

## Data Structure

The `collabs.json` file contains an array of collaboration objects matching the Sanity `collab` schema:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "unique-id",
    "_type": "collab",
    "name": "Collaboration Name",
    "slug": { "current": "url-slug", "_type": "slug" },
    "genre": "Music Genre",
    "location": "Location",
    "shortDescription": "Brief description",
    "useShortDescriptionForCards": true,
    "cardDescription": "Optional card description",
    "bio": "Longer biography",
    "mainContent": [...], // Page sections with content blocks
    "links": {...}, // Social media links
    "sideContent": [...], // Sidebar content blocks
    "seoTitle": "SEO title",
    "seoDescription": "SEO description"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Make sure your `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` has write permissions
2. **Schema Mismatches**: Ensure your Sanity schema is up to date with the latest collaboration types
3. **Reference Errors**: Internal links may need to be updated to point to actual documents

### Checking Results

After running the script:

1. Go to your Sanity Studio
2. Navigate to "ü§ù Collaborations"
3. You should see the imported collaborations
4. Click on each to review and complete the content

## Extending the Script

To add more collaborations:

1. Add new collaboration objects to `collabs.json`
2. Follow the existing structure and field naming
3. Re-run the script

The script will detect existing collaborations and add new ones without duplicating existing content.
